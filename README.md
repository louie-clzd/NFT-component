# Frontend Mentor - NFT preview card component solution

## This is a solution to the [NFT preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Links

- Live Site URL: (https://louie-clzd.github.io/NFT-component/)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to properly center a component thanks to helpful advice from a front-end mentor user. I practiced understanding hover states.

### Continued development

For the future I will practice on learning how to successfully implement hover states using CSS. As of now it is glitchy hovering over the NFT image.
